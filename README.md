## Security is boring, what else?
Unlike army soldiers, Sentinel knows how to have fun, instead of just having security and leaving it there, there are a few categories of rich, enjoyable, extra categories of commands such as:
- **Economy**
    - Become the second richest person (because Untraceable is first all the time, or is she? ) in this economy system from begging on the streets for spare change to working as a multimillionare invester. (jobs and such will come soon trust me ;) 
- **Games**
    - There are a bunch of games you can play within discord within a command!

So what are you waiting for? Invite Sentinel now!

## How do I use it?
I would prefer if you would just invite the [bot](https://dsc.gg/security), but because someone is going to run their own instance because they have severe trust issues, so I may as well hold their hand the entire way through it.

    - Step One
        - Install Docker
        - Install the repository.
        - Lucky for you, I made a Dockerfile so that you can easily run the bot, even if you're on Linux, Potato, or even rooted android! I don't know if it works.

    - Step Two
        - Configure the bot.
        - Simply add a config.json within the "Bot Files" directory.
        - After this, add some data which should make the file look like the example-config.json.

    - Step Three
        - Build the Dockerfile
        - Simply make sure you're in the directory containing my Dockerfile
        - Run "docker build ."
      
    - Step Four
        - Run the Docker Container
        - When you ran the docker build command, it should return something like "sha256:random_letters_well_not_really_just_sha256_encrypted_letters?"
        - Remove the "sha256:" part and then run "docker run {whatever_you_have_here}"
        - If you have any issues, don't hesitate to join the Discord, link below.
